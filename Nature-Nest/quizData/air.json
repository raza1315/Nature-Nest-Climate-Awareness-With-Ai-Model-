Ozone at the Earth’s surface is a main ingredient in smog but is not emitted directly from car exhausts. It is formed when pollution from vehicles, factories and other sources reacts in sunlight. Sunny California has the perfect conditions for unhealthy levels of ozone to form."

      "sol": "Ground-level ozone: NASA satellites have been measuring the amount of ozone in our atmosphere for over 30 years. However, since most of the ozone exists high in the stratosphere, it is difficult to measure ozone levels in the troposphere precisely, the layer of the atmosphere closest to the surface where we live and breathe. Pollutants in the troposphere measured by the Aura satellite include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and some volatile organic compounds (such as formaldehyde)."

      ],
      "sol": "Both: Ozone is a gas made of three atoms of oxygen and occurs in both Earth’s upper atmosphere and at ground level. It can be good or bad for us depending on where it is found. When in or above the stratosphere (the higher atmosphere that ranges from 5 to 11 miles up), ozone forms a crucial sunscreen – the ozone layer – that protects us from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. But ozone can also act as a pollutant at ground level, formed when pollution (say from cars) reacts with sunlight. A main ingredient of smog is ozone, which burns the lungs when breathed in and can trigger asthma attacks. NASA monitors the ozone layer and lower-level ozone using satellites and instruments on planes and on the ground."
